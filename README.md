    A simple Application which provides 5 days of weather forecast for the current location.
    This application is developed as a Hybrid Mobile and Web application using Cordova, AngularJS,
    HTML5 and CSS3.
    Also uses OpenWeather API for weather forecast. (http://openweathermap.org/forecast5)
    Application is compatible with iOS and Android devices as well mobile browsers.

# What next?
  As i got only 4 hours of time, the functionalities are limited in this application.
  I would have provided a option to change and add user locations.
  Although it is responsive, considering the time frame I focused more on mobile UI. 
  If more time is given would have lot more justice to UI specially for web.
  Would also like to include forecast for hour based, customised notifications for User.
